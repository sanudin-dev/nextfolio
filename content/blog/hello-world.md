This is a **sample post**. You can replace this file and add more `.md` files in `content/blog/` to publish new articles.

- No database needed: each file is one post.
- Use frontmatter for `title`, `description`, and `date`.
- Write the body in Markdown.

You’ll deal with the rest of the content later.
